# Time

Analysis of how I've spent every minute of my time over the past several months.

## What

I've been tracking every minute of every day for the past few months using an app on my phone. After exporting to CSV format,
I can then create visualizations and statistical analyses on the data.

## Results: Check it out [here](Time.md)!

## How

#### See the source code [here](Time.Rmd)

I used Python to clean up the data, and R to further manipulate it and create the visualizations.

Both the Python and the R code was embedded in an `Rmd` (R-Markdown) file, which was then `knit` into a rendered `md` file
with code output (including visualizations) embedded.
